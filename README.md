# CVT Function Library

This library contains functions to generate Centroidal Voronoi points in n-dimensional space. 

## Point Generation

Monte Carlo Points are generated randomly on the unit hypercube according to a given density function. 

```python
   gensample(n, density=uniform, dim=2)
```

```python
   ## srs_sample_test.py ##
   import cvt_processing as cvt
   
   # 2D Example
   uniform_pts  = cvt.gensample(100)
   gauss_pts    = cvt.gensample(100, cvt.gauss)
   sinusoid_pts = cvt.gensample(100, density=cvt.sinusoid)

   # 5D Example
   uniform_pts_5d  = cvt.gensample(3, dim=5)
   gauss_pts_5d    = cvt.gensample(3, density=cvt.gauss, dim=5)
   sinusoid_pts_5d = cvt.gensample(3, cvt.sinusoid, 5)

   ...
```

While randomly generated points are necessary, they can occasionally "clump," lelading to an uneven distribution. To alleviate this, four other methods of point generation are included, two with random elements and two entirely deterministic. Each method adds a degree of spatial uniformity to the selection of points.

Kmeans++ is a method of Monte Carlo sampling in which each point is randomly selected proportional to the distance between it and the closest point already selected. That is to say, points further away from already selected points are more likely to be selected. The exponent chosen for this distance, with the default being 2, determines by what influence distance has on point selection.

Both the Halton and Hammersley are generated through Halton sequences, in which a prime number is used to generate a pseudo-random sequence of numbers. The nth dimension of a Halton point set is generated by a Halton sequence from the nth prime number. Hammersley points are generated similarly, but require knowing how many points are sampled in total. The first dimension of points is sampled exactly uniformly for its length, subsequent dimensions are generated from subsequent Halton sequences.

Lainized Hypercube points are selected such that each point occupies a particular "row" and "column" in 2D, and can be easily expanded to higher dimensions. This generates a random selection of points, but ensures that the points are not clustered around a particular location. Other point sets can be "latinized" as well, giving them the same "row" and "column" uniqueness while preserving the point sets general shape.
